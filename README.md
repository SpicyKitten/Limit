This used to be the project I made for "Linking Incomplete Mathematical Identifiers Together".

Then I realized that it could be computed using basic string interpolation and a REPL.

So, instead, it contains the very raw beginnings of a programming language parser.

However, since the programming language was never clearly specified in terms of syntax/features, it's right now just a barer-than-barebones parser that supports string interpolation.
